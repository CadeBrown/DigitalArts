# DigitalArts

This is a collection of my digital arts 1 projects

## Name Scheme

For naming schemes, use this:

`Brown_Cade_{PROJECT}.{EXTENSION}`

Or, for multiple versions, use:

`Brown_Cade_{PROJECT}_{VERSION}.{EXTENSION}


`{PROJECT}` is the name of the project, in camelcase, and without spaces.

So, `FractalExplorer`, `MoonPhases` are all examples

`{VERSION}` is a version string, and should start with a `v`

So, `v1`, `v2`, etc are correct
